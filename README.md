# Toy Bank Implementation with Vaults

This is a CLI in Lean that mimics a digital bank. The bank keeps vaults, can open accounts, deposit, withdraw, transfer, query balance, and close accounts.

## CLI Commands 

* `open`
* `deposit id_to qty`
* `withdraw id_from qty`
* `transfer id_from id_to qty`
* `bal id`
* `close id`
